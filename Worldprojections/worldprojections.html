    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:rgb(178, 178, 252)">How I displayed maps in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>First, I downloaded a world map shape file that also depicts the world's country borders. 
        After importing this file into QGIS, I changed Coordinate Reference System to whichever projection 
        I wanted to use. The default projection was WGS84 (EPSG:4326). I also needed to install a plug-in
        for my projections. Using the "Manage and Install Plug-ins" feature, I was able to install the Indicatrix
        Mapper. This plug-in added a layer of circles and latitude/longitude lines over my shape file that
        help visualize the distortion put on the map by different projections.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This variant of the Mercator projection preserves the shape of countries and direction, but distorts their area. Notice how Greenland, a country 1/8the size of Africa, appears just as large as the African continent. 
        The closer a country is to the equator, the less distortion it suffers. This projection is commonly used in classrooms and is used by Google Maps.

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This modified azimuthal projection is similar to the Mercantor projection, but has some key differences. The first being its rounded 
        appearance. This shape helps to display the full shape of the continents (compare this full, round Antarctica to the Mercator's squarish, rolled out appearance),
        but suffers more distortion around the edges of the map. It preserves country shape while distorting area; however, this projection sees far less area distortion 
        than the Mercator. Notice how small Greenland looks on this projection!

    <h2> Pseudo-Mercantor Projection</h2>
    <h3>This cylindrical projection is also called the Web Mercator projection 
        because it is commonly used on computers to look at the Earth. It is useful because 
        although it distorts area and shape, it preserves direction.

    <h2>Winkel Tripel Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection has a round shape resulting in less distortion of area and shape near 
        the poles. This map is a compromise between distortion of area, distance, and direction.

    <h2>Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection has a distinct horizontal stretch. This map preserves the area of countries
        and direction, but it distorts their shapes. There is minimal distortion along the Equator. It looks like it could be created by wrapping a cylinder around a globe
        horizontally, with the bases oriented facing east and west.

    <h2>Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection preserves distances along meridians but distorts shape, area,
        direction, and angles between latitude/longitude lines. On this projection, distortion is minimal
        around the North Pole, but increases with distance from the North Pole. Interestingly, Antarctica appears bigger than all
        other land masses combined.

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is extremely similar to the Equidistant Conic projection,
        but its cone shape seems to wrap completely around the globe. Compare this projection 
        Anarctica which meets end to end with the previous projection's Antarctica which has a 
        significant gap between the two edges. This projection also sees minimal distortion around
        the North Pole and immense distortion with increasing distance from its center. This projection 
        is used by the United Nations. It stands out to me because it shows how closely connected
        the continents are and how they are also quite concentrated in the northern hemisphere.

    <h2>Polyconic Projection</h2>
    <h3>Unlike the last two projections, this projection preserves area and shape
        around both of the globe's poles. It preserves shape, area, distance, and direction
        along the Prime Meridian. This projection curves the rest of the globe around 
        the poles giving us the most accurate depiction of Antarctica's shape and size 
        compared to any other projections I have included on this site.

    <h2>Van der Grinten Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection preserves area and shape along the Equator, Tropic of Cancer, and Tropic
        of Capricorn, but suffers extreme distortion along the Poles. It has a rounded shape with no 
        curvature along the Prime Meridian, but increasing curvature along longitude lines
        moving away from the Prime Meridian.
